## QA
Hi! I'm Isabel! My role in this project was QA. I assured that every bug was correctly tracked  in order to keep them all into account when solving them, always tracking priority and severity levels.

## Character Art
Along with QA, I mainly worked on the character art for the game. The following are the tasks that I realized in this project.
- Character design for adult Link and Zelda
- Zelda mechanics design
- Character animations, including all of the adult Link and part of Zelda
- Map design, mainly the forest map and houses' interiors
- Arranging spritesheets
